# Casio Calculator Ham Tools

This repo contains various useful calculation tools for amateur radio operators, specifically designed to run on Casio calculator models that support MicroPython.

When working on my ham radio projects I found myself performing certain calculations often. For example, I often made use of online calculators to calculate the dimensions of a Yagi-Uda antenna based on the operating frequency. I wanted to be able to do a large number of multi-step calculations right from my calculator so I wrote these various python files and designed them so that they can be run on the built-in MicroPython interpreter that is included on certain Casio calculators. 

Note: Most of the files have comments which you may want to remove after reading them since these calculators don't have very much storage. Each file also prints out instructions upon being run but aren't necessary to keep after the user has become familiarized with them.
